@Borderlands I'm unable to access any forums so I figured I would try here. When I'm in Boarderlands 3 if I turn to the right so that characters who are speaking are on my left side I cant hear them at all. This is on PS4. Is there some where you can point me to, to fix this?	0

Super fun game, would highly HIGHLY recommend putting it. And it â€™ s literally free right now, so what reason do you all have to not really try it? Of course, and I â€™ d recommend you playing the near others in Borderlands games long before this one for story purposes, but it won â€™ t likely be free forever so go get it going anyway.	1
